How to Fix the Brand Logo Issue Using phpMyAdmin

The error you're seeing happens because the code is trying to use a column named 'brand_logo' that doesn't exist in your brands table. Here's how to fix it using phpMyAdmin:

1. Open XAMPP Control Panel and make sure Apache and MySQL are running
2. Click on the "Admin" button next to MySQL (or go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/)
3. In phpMyAdmin, click on your database name "cars_data" in the left sidebar
4. Click on the "brands" table
5. Click on the "Structure" tab
6. Click on "Add column" 
7. Enter the following information:
   - Name: brand_logo
   - Type: VARCHAR
   - Length/Values: 255
   - Default: NULL
   - Collation: [leave empty]
   - Attributes: [leave empty]
   - Null: check the box
   - Index: [leave empty]
   - A_I: [leave empty]
   - Comments: [leave empty]
8. Click "Save"

Alternative: Direct SQL Method
1. In phpMyAdmin, select your database "cars_data"
2. Click on the "SQL" tab
3. Paste this exact SQL command:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE brands ADD COLUMN brand_logo VARCHAR(255) NULL AFTER description;
   ```
4. Click "Go" to execute the query

After adding the column, make sure your uploads/brand_logos directory exists:
1. Navigate to your website directory: C:\xampp\htdocs\cars\home_page\
2. Create a folder named "uploads" if it doesn't exist
3. Inside the uploads folder, create another folder named "brand_logos"

Now you should be able to add brands with logos without getting the error.
